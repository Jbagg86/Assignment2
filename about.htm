    <h2>About Us</h2> 
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;color: darkred;">Welcome to Luka Clearance Sale! Thanks to a terrible GM, we can offer all Luka merchandise at a steep discount.
            That stupid guy thinks that the 25 year old phenom that averaged 34/9/9 and took us to the finals last year, is 
            somehow so out of shape that he will miss more games than the most injured big man in the league and not last as 
            long as the guy that is 6 years his senior. Our owners approved because they want to move the team to Vegas and 
            the GM was probably paid millions under the table to help out his long-time friends in LA. Our shady, rediculous loss,
            your gain!</p>
